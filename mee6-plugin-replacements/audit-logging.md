Except for a fact that, the most important, Message events is locked up behind premium. Honestly, Message event logging is very important, even more if invite posted is behind premium, you will never figure out what the person deleted, or edited without MEE6 Premium!

### 🔍 Alternative 1 - [Logger](https://logger.bot/)

Some events? What are some? Don’t worry, the logger won’t skimp out on logs! With a single command, you can let the logger log everything the API lets it log about your server!
